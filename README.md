# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
      Interpreting user needs is easier when you have an understanding of what you are trying to build. That way you can envision their feedback and needs better. This helps in creating user stories that help the development team understand what it is they are wanting. When they understand clearly what the users are wanting, they can implement them more efficiently without confusion.
            
      
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    I approach developing programs by trying to think about it in real world terms. What is the objective in creating this, how can I make it better, how can I make it benefit others or even myself? When these questions answered, I like to go into the design phase of how to make it come to life. I roadmap a start middle and end in basic terms and build from the start with what I have in mind for the middle and end. I really hope to encorporate the use of Sprints and Product backlog. The idea of having sprints in agile seems rather fun to me and I would love to be a part of this experience. 
    
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    I feel a good team member is built around communication. I have said this a lot through the course but communication is key to the success of a project in a team environment. This is because you are on a team and all working on the same project but on different aspects or oversights. When you can effectively communicate with others on your team, you are using your time efficiently by getting your point or questions across correctly the first time. This saves time for everyone. Colloboration is also a great impact on learning and quicker development. You are relying on the others strong areas to help learn from your weaker areas. It also helps in coming up with a solution quicker when you have multiple minds on a given problem.
